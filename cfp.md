# Call for Papers

The ACM SIGCOMM 2017 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions to the field of 
computer and data communication networks. We invite submissions on a wide range of networking research, 
including, but not limited to:

- Network architectures and algorithms
- Enterprise, datacenter, and storage area networks
- SDN, NFV and network programming
- Experimental results from operational networks or network applications
- Economic aspects of the Internet
- Energy-aware communication
- Network management
- Network security and privacy
- Network, transport, and application-layer protocols
- Fault-tolerance, reliability, and troubleshooting
- Operating system and host support for networking
- P2P, overlay, and content distribution networks
- Resource management, QoS, and signaling
- Routing, traffic engineering, switching, and addressing
- Wireless, mobile, and sensor networks
- Innovative uses of network data beyond communication

In addition to the main conference, SIGCOMM 2017 will have a series of co-located workshops, tutorials, poster 
and demo sessions, a travel grant program, and conference best paper and SIGCOMM awards.

## Submissions


SIGCOMM is a highly selective conference where full papers typically report novel results firmly substantiated by experimentation, 
deployment, simulation, or analysis. Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to 12 pages in length with 
as many additional pages as necessary for references. 
<!-- Detailed submission instructions can be found <a href="submission.html">here</a>. -->


## Experience Track

SIGCOMM 2017 will include a submission category for experience papers on the design, analysis, and evaluation of techniques in commercial 
(or otherwise widespread) deployment. Authors must explicitly indicate whether a submission is to be considered for this track or 
the standard track. (Further information in the detailed submission instructions.)


## Ethical Concerns

Authors must as part of the submission process attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of 
their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. 
Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient -- in cases 
where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of 
the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available 
at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.
