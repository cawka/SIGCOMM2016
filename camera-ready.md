For each event of SIGCOMM 2017 that publishes proceedings, the proceedings will be produced via the HotCRP site used for the review process. The HotCRP site will collect the final papers and interface with the ACM to manage publication rights for the papers.

The authors must revise the original submission to address the reviewers' concerns and, if the paper is subject to shepherding, obtain an explicit approval of the final version from the shepherd.

For the final paper to be published, it is imperative to prepare the final version using the sigconf template from the [2017 ACM consolidated template package](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) ([you can also use this barebone LaTeX template](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template)). Different from the traditional SIGCOMM template, the sigconf template allocates less space for the paper content on the first page and uses a 9-point font. Do not number pages. Embed all the fonts in the PDF file.

As described on the above template webpage, the authors should provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available on [ACM CCS website](https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012).

The authors must insert the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip into the final paper. The ACM will use its automated system to email this information to the authors. Please set your email spam settings to allow messages from "rightsreview@acm.org".

If you have any questions about the camera-ready process, feel free to contact SIGCOMM 2017 publication chair [Sergey Gorinsky](mailto:sergey.gorinsky@imdea.org?subject=[SIGCOMM 2017]).
