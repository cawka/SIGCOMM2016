  note: N2Women dinner will be held on Monday, the night before the conference, in Centennial Hall (Salon C/Salon D) in Luskin Center. N2Women Dinner aims to foster the minority community within SIGCOMM, and make it easier for the under-represented attendees to fully participate in the conference. Attendees will have the opportunity to meet multiple senior members of the community from universities, research labs and industry. The dinner is open to everyone who identifies with any minority, not just women. Please RSVP on the registration site if you plan to attend.
