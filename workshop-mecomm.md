### Call For Papers

Future mobile networks aim to support low latency, context-related service offering, personalised service delivery and highly flexible and efficient resource management. One attractive approach to these goals introduces virtualized storage and compute resources at the edge of the network, having closer proximity to mobile subscribers as a way of reducing end-to-end latency and time-to-response, while increasing the flexibility and agility of allocating resources. The Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm takes this approach facilitating computation and storage capabilities at the edge, with a particular focus on their interaction with applications and services. In a similar fashion, Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) brings advantages related to the flexible instantiation and management of network functionality on top of virtualized compute, storage and network resources.

The workshop focuses on the interplay between NFV and MEC domains; stimulating research efforts that marry the requirements of virtual computing with the requirements of virtual networking in a number of aspects, including: enabling application- and/or service-awareness in network functions (e.g., service-aware routing), distributing and networking compute resources, high-speed data planes, programmable control and management planes, resiliency and security of mobile edge clouds and networks. The outcomes of the workshop should levitate communication frameworks that have the ability to accommodate the expanding range of business models, applications and services, within future mobile networks.

The workshop will solicit papers that address aspects of the above areas; particularly, encouraging papers that address cross-layer research issues in any combination of these areas, bridging the gaps between network softwarization, virtualization and cloud/edge computing.

#### Submission Instructions

Submission implies the willingness of at least one author to attend the workshop and present the paper. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM SIGCOMM conference proceedings. Workshop organizers reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the workshop if the paper is not presented at the conference.
Submitted papers should contain original material that have not be previously published, nor currently submitted for consideration elsewhere. All submissions should be written in English, with a maximum length limit of 6 printed pages, including all the figures, references and appendices. The ACM SIGCOMM LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as related information, can be found at the [ACM SIG Proceedings website](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Specifically, please note the following format requirements:

- All papers submitted will be peer-reviewed (single-blind) and evaluated based on their suitability (i.e., within the workshop scope), novelty, and merit.
- All papers must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically. Whatever text processor or formatter you use to write your paper (LaTeX, Microsoft Word, FrameMaker, etc.), please convert the output to PDF before submission.
- Submissions must be limited to **6 pages**, single-spaced, double-column, with each column 9.25" by 3.33", 0.33" space between columns, use at least a 10pt font, and be correctly formatted to be printed on letter-sized (8.5" by 11") paper. **<red>Submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed.</red>**
- We must be able to print your paper once it is submitted. Therefore, all fonts used in the paper MUST be embedded in the submitted PDF file.
- The paper must be in a state where it can be printed clearly on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to view your paper in color.

Please submit your paper via [https://mecomm-sigcomm17.hotcrp.com/](https://mecomm-sigcomm17.hotcrp.com/)
