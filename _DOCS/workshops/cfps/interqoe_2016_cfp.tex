QoE-based Analysis and Management of Data Communication Networks}}

\section{Call for Papers}
\vspace{2mm}

Measuring and analyzing complex networks such as the Internet has been the focus 
of many research efforts for over two decades now. While this approach has lead 
to an improved understanding of the Internet and an enhancement of the 
management and operation of large-scale complex networks, little has been done 
to understand and manage the traffic and the network from a user-centric 
perspective. QoE remains a poorly understood domain, currently restricted to 
small scale lab studies and very far from the analysis of real large scale 
traffic measurements and networks. Especially in the industry, QoE has become a 
buzz word, far from its reality within the research community, and partly due to 
the complexity involved in deploying QoE-based network analysis and management 
solutions.

In addition, network operators and service providers currently struggle to keep 
their increasingly demanding customers happy in an increasingly competitive and 
complex environment, while remaining profitable at the same time. The sheer 
development of novel end-user services demands more and better user-centric 
quality concepts and metrics applied to real world operational networks. We see 
current and future networks becoming more and more end-user experience aware, 
but there is still a long way to go to make of QoE one of the guiding paradigms 
for network design, management, and operation. As a first step, we need to 
better understand real networks and their traffic through the eyes of the 
end-user.

The goal of the \wname workshop is to scale QoE out of the lab studies context 
and bring it to the design, analysis and operation of real world networks and 
traffic. By fostering an explicit and deep integration of the end-user directly 
into the analysis and management of traffic and networks, we expect to reduce 
the gap between QoE research and its application to future network management 
paradigms, as well as to provide a more targeted end-user perspective to the 
research on Internet analysis and its future development.

\wname brings together researchers and practitioners from the Internet 
measurements and analysis domain and the QoE modeling and assessment domain, as 
well as industry players willing to integrate QoE aspects into the DNA of their 
daily business, with direct applications in network dimensioning, monitoring, 
management, and troubleshooting among others. We invite submissions in the 
following non-exhaustive list of topics:

\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Submission Instructions}
\vspace{2mm}

Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not under consideration at 
another conference or journal. Submitted papers must be at most six (6) pages
