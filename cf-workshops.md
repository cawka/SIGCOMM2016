SIGCOMM 2017 is soliciting proposals for new and recurring workshops. SIGCOMM 2017 will hold multiple one-day workshops in conjunction with the conference, to be held in Los Angeles, CA, USA from August 21 to 25, 2017. Workshops will take place on Monday, August 21 and Friday, August 25.

We invite you to submit workshop proposals on any topic related to the broad set of research and application areas covered by the SIGCOMM conference. We welcome workshops on topics in network research, practice, and education. The workshop format itself should favor interaction among participants and community building. We welcome returning workshops.

A workshop proposal should contain at least the following information:

- Motivation and rationale for the workshop.

- A draft Call for Papers (CFP), as complete as possible.

- The workshop deadlines, both internal and external. See below for guidelines on important external guidelines.

- Names and affiliations of main organizers. If the workshop is not a teaching workshop, include a tentative composition of the committees (as complete as possible). Please indicate whether prospective TPC members have been contacted, and whether they have accepted the invitation.

- Workshop format, including expected number of presented papers, invited talks, panels, demonstrations, etc.

- Expected number of participants and the expected number of submissions (if appropriate).

- Prior history of this workshop, if any, including number of submissions, number of accepted papers, and attendee count. If the workshop was co-located with another conference please include details and a brief description why SIGCOMM is a more appropriate venue.

- A list of people whom you have solicited (or plan to solicit) to participate at the workshop. If the workshop is interdisciplinary, please provide details about your plans to advertise to other communities and how you intend to encourage participation at the workshop.

- If appropriate, a brief explanation of how the workshop relates to other workshops and conferences on similar topics.

The workshop organizers should also take into account the following practical considerations:

- The room capacity is approximately 100 attendees.

- A/V (projector and screen) will be provided in all workshop rooms, which may also be equipped with microphone and speakers.

- There will be Wi-Fi coverage in all areas of the conference, including the workshop rooms. Any specific networking requirements should be stated in the proposal.

- We will require all workshops to have identical start, end and break times.
