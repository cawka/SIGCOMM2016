## {{ page.title }}

The main goal of N2Women workshop is to foster connections among the under-represented women in computer networking and related research fields. The 5th N2Women Workshop also welcomes under-represented men who share the same research interests, attend the same conferences, and often face the same career hurdles and obstacles to join us!

## Mentoring Program

N2 Women will have a mentor/mentee program. We would like to extend mentoring throughout the week for the students who are staying for SIGCOMM. In this case, we are hoping to find mentors who can host mentees with similar research interests during the main SIGCOMM conference and workshops. If you are a SIGCOMM regular attendee and a senior researcher, please consider volunteering as a mentor. If you are interested in helping out, please email one of the mentoring session organizers below:

## Call for Posters

Posters are solicited for research related to any aspect of networking and communications. All researchers in the networking and communications fields are welcome to submit their work for presentation at this workshop. Each poster abstract will be reviewed by members of the TPC. Posters will not be published and hence can be under submission for other conferences or workshops. Two posters will be selected to receive a best poster award generously sponsored by Hewlett Packard Laboratories. Travel grants are available for selected students.

## Poster Submission

Each submission should be formatted as an extended abstract, describing the research to be presented in the poster. The length of the extended abstract should be at most TWO pages (formatted into the US letter size of 8.5 Ã— 11 inches with fonts no smaller than 10 point size), including all figures and references. The extended abstract must include the names, affiliations and email addresses of all authors and should be submitted as a single PDF file to EasyChair: [TBD](#TBD)

## Travel Grant

N2Women is pleased to provide travel grants to broaden the participation in our workshop. Applicants for the travel award should apply using the following link: [TBD](#TBD)
