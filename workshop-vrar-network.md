### Call For Papers

Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are expected to be the next generation Killer-Apps in the future Internet. This workshop will bring together researchers and developers working on VR/AR and networking to share their experience, exchange views, and explore future research directions. Contemporary video applications increasingly require more pixels, higher frame rate, shorter delay, and lower packet loss rate. Immersive VR/AR videos are the representative applications. VR/AR is projected to form a $162 billion market by 2020. However, many technical bottlenecks and challenges need to be overcome to facilitate the wide adoption of VR/AR. In particular, high-throughput and low-latency data transmission, realtime video generation and adaption call for significant engineering innovations, which can only happen through interdisciplinary research. The Workshop will bring together experts from different fields, including video coding, communication, networking, and system to exchange ideas on novel network architecture and protocol designs to support VR/AR, as well as novel video coding and transmission designs to deliver immersive VR/AR experience in future networks.

The ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality Network aims to foster a higher representation of researchers working on VR/AR network at SIGCOMM. The workshop will also serve as a meeting point for worldwide researchers to share new ideas and experiences and to discuss the challenges linked to the development of VR/AR network.

#### Topics of Interest

We solicit stimulating, original, previously unpublished ideas on completed work, position papers, and/or work-in-progress papers in the form of extended abstracts. We further encourage papers that propose new research directions or could generate lively debate at the workshop. We invite submissions on a wide range of VR/AR network research topics, including, but not limited to:

- Joint video coding and transmission design
- Networking requirements and challenges of VR/AR
- Ultra-low-latency networking
- High-throughput transport for VR/AR
- Adaptive video streaming under network/user constraints
- Novel content distribution network for VR/AR
- Management of VR/AR network
- Wireless and mobile video systems
- VR/AR in 5G Networks

#### Submission Instructions

Submissions must be original, unpublished work, and not under consideration at another conference or journal. Submitted papers must be at most six (6) pages long, including all figures, tables, references, and appendices in two-column 10pt ACM format. Papers must include authorâ€™s names and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the PC. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their papers at the workshop.

Paper registration and submission can be done via HotCRP at: [https://sigcomm17vrar.hotcrp.com/](https://sigcomm17vrar.hotcrp.com/).
